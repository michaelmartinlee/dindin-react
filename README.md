# DinDin Remake in React

Going back to the beginning of the journey with [DinDin](https://github.com/rafaelsangali/project-dindin), which was originally made in HTML. I remade it by applying concepts I learned in React.

## ✌🏻​ Getting Started

If you want to see it in action, just [click here](https://dindin-react.vercel.app/).

If you want to run it on your machine, simply follow these commands:

git clone https://github.com/rafaelsangali/gama-react.git

and to install the packages and dependencies:

npm install


## 📄 Reinforcing Learnings

- Refactoring code
- Componentizing elements that repeat
